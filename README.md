## Welcome to the GitHub repository for our research project on the interactions of multiple stressors and cumulative effects in salmonids! This repository contains the necessary database and R code to perform in-depth analyses and explore the complex relationships between various stressors and their cumulative impacts on salmonid populations.

# Research Overview

Salmonids, including species like salmon and trout, play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems and have significant economic and ecological importance. However, these species are facing numerous stressors, such as habitat degradation, pollution, climate change, and fishing pressure. Understanding how these stressors interact and contribute to cumulative effects is essential for effective conservation and management strategies.
